# loopback webring

A dead-simple, **fully static**, **invite-only** [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring):
a loop of personal websites that link to one another. No backend, no database, no build step.
Deploys free to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host.

## How it works

The whole ring is driven by `webring.json`, an **ordered** array of members:

```json
[
  { "name": "you",     "gh": "your-github-username", "url": "https://your-site.com", "invitedBy": "founder" },
  { "name": "ada",     "gh": "torvalds",             "url": "https://ada.example.com", "invitedBy": "you" }
]
```

`name`, `gh`, and `url` are the basics (`gh` is optional; it just pulls the GitHub avatar).
`invitedBy` records who vouched for each member: use `"founder"` for the people who started
the ring, and the inviter's handle for everyone else. It's shown on each card and is how the
invite-only model stays honest.

`index.html` fetches that file and renders the directory. `go.html` reads it too and resolves
navigation entirely in the browser:

| Link                                   | Goes to                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `go.html?from=NAME&dir=next`           | the member **after** NAME (wraps around)  |
| `go.html?from=NAME&dir=prev`           | the member **before** NAME (wraps around) |
| `/random/` (or `go.html?dir=random`)   | a random member                           |

The homepage has a **lights on / lights out** toggle (parchment ↔ green-phosphor CRT); the
choice is remembered in `localStorage`.

## How to join the ring (invite-only)

Membership is invite-only. People can't add themselves. A current member vouches for the newcomer,
and an admin merges the PR. Full step-by-step instructions live in [`JOIN.md`](JOIN.md), which is
the file you hand to anyone you invite. The short version:

1. An existing member invites you (they'll give you their handle).
2. You fork the repo and add your entry to the **end** of `webring.json`, with `invitedBy` set to
   your inviter's handle.
3. You add the ring navigation to your own site (grab the auto-filled snippet from the homepage).
4. You open a pull request naming your inviter. An admin confirms the vouch and merges.

### How invite-only is actually enforced

A static site can't verify anything on its own: the member list is public and any forker can type
`"invitedBy": "anyone"`. So verification happens at the **one real gate, the pull request**, using
the fact that GitHub authenticates who submits a review.

The included Action, [`.github/workflows/validate-membership.yml`](.github/workflows/validate-membership.yml),
runs on every join PR and posts a status check called `invite/vouch`. It passes **only** when:

1. the diff is a clean single self-addition (it rejects PRs that edit or remove other members, add
   more than one entry, or touch any file other than `webring.json`);
2. the new entry is well-formed (`name`, `url`, optional `gh`) and `invitedBy` names a current member;
3. **that member's own GitHub account submits an approving review on the PR** (a maintainer approval
   also counts, e.g. for `founder` entries).

Point 3 is what makes it unfakeable. Writing `invitedBy: "dhh"` does nothing on its own — only
`dhh`'s authenticated account clicking **Approve** flips the check green. The bot leaves a comment
tagging the inviter and explaining what's needed.

**Two things you must set up once (they can't live in a file):**

1. Edit the `MAINTAINERS` line in the workflow to your admin GitHub username(s).
2. Turn on **branch protection** for `main`: Settings → Branches → add rule →
   *Require a pull request before merging* + *Require status checks to pass* → select
   **`invite/vouch`** → *Restrict who can merge* to your admins. Without this, the check still runs
   but nothing forces it to be green before merge.

## Rebranding it (name, colours, URL)

Everything brandable lives in one place — the `CONFIG` object at the top of **`webring.js`**:

```js
const CONFIG = {
  name:    "loopback",                       // ring name
  tagline: "a hand-made ring of ...",        // subtitle
  baseUrl: "https://loopback.example.com",   // where this site is deployed (for the snippet)
  dataUrl: "webring.json",
};
```

Change the palette via the CSS variables at the top of `index.html` (`--paper`, `--navy`,
`--link`, etc.). The wordmark text lives in the `.banner` block of `index.html`.

> **Important:** set `CONFIG.baseUrl` to your real deployed URL — the copy-paste embed snippet
> uses it, and members will paste broken links otherwise.

## Deploying

**GitHub Pages:** push this folder to a repo, then Settings → Pages → deploy from `main` /
root. Done. (Serve over HTTP — opening `index.html` as a `file://` will fail because browsers
block `fetch` of local files.)

**Netlify / Vercel:** drag-and-drop the folder, or point it at the repo. No build command,
publish directory = this folder.

## Credits

The webring concept and the "join by PR-ing a JSON file" workflow are an old web tradition.
This is an independent, from-scratch static implementation with its own design.
